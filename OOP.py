                                        *** Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) ***

ðŸ”¹ Definition:
Object-Oriented Programming is a method of solving real-world problems using **classes** and **objects**.

---

ðŸ”¹ Key Features of OOP:
- Security  
- Code Reusability  
- Scalability  
- Fewer lines of code compared to Procedural-Oriented Programming (POP)

---

ðŸ”¹ Four Pillars of OOP:
1. **Inheritance** â€“ Reusing code from one class in another  
2. **Encapsulation** â€“ Hiding internal details and exposing only necessary parts  
3. **Polymorphism** â€“ Performing a single action in different ways  
4. **Abstraction** â€“ Showing only essential features and hiding complexity

---

ðŸ”¹ Class:
Every real-world entity can be modeled as a class.  
- **Attributes** â†’ Variables (e.g., name, age)  
- **Behaviors** â†’ Functions (e.g., walk(), speak())

ðŸ“Œ Definition:  
A **class** is a blueprint for creating objects.  
Its attributes and behaviors are shared with the objects created from it.

---

ðŸ”¹ Object:
An **object** is an instance of a class.  
It represents a specific example of the blueprint defined by the class.

*** Creating Objects in OOP ***

ðŸ”¹ To create an object from a class:
Assign the class name followed by parentheses to a variable.

ðŸ“Œ Syntax:
obj = ClassName()

ðŸ“Œ Example:
obj = c1()  # Creates an object of class c1

                *** Object Independence in OOP ***

ðŸ”¹ When an object changes its attribute(e.g., color), it does **not** affect other objects of the same class.

ðŸ“Œ Example:
If `obj1.color = "red"`  
Then `obj2.color` remains unchanged unless explicitly modified.

ðŸ§  Why?
Each object has its **own copy** of the class attributes (unless they are class-level/static variables).  
This ensures **object independence** in behavior and state.

                    *** Class Attributes and Methods in OOP ***

ðŸ”¹ Attributes:
- Attributes store data or state related to a class or object.
- They can be modified by either the class itself or its objects.
- Typically represent **static information** (e.g., name, age, color).

ðŸ”¹ Methods:
- Methods define actions or behaviors associated with a class.
- They operate on attributes and perform tasks (e.g., display info, update values).

ðŸ§  Summary:
- **Attributes** = Data (variables)
- **Methods** = Actions (functions)

                        *** Class Variables in OOP ***

ðŸ”¹ Definition:
Class variables are shared across all instances of a class.  
They hold the same value for every object unless modified at the class level.

---

ðŸ”¹ Characteristics:
- Stored at the class level, not per object.
- Accessible via both `ClassName.variable` and `object.variable`.
- Ideal for values that should be consistent across all objects (e.g., counters, configuration flags).
 
---

ðŸ”¹ Ways to Declare Class Variables:

1. **Inside the class, outside any method**
   class MyClass:
       count = 0  # class variable
       
2.Inside a method using the class name
    class MyClass:
        def update():
        MyClass.count = 10
        
3.Outside the class using the class name
    My Class.count = 20
