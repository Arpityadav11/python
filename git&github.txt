# ✅ Git vs GitHub — Placement-Ready Definitions

## 🔹 Git
> Git is a **distributed version control system (VCS)** used to track changes in source code during development.  
It enables multiple developers to collaborate, manage versions, and maintain a history of code changes efficiently.

### 🔑 Key Features
- Local and remote repositories
- Branching and merging
- Commit history and rollback
- Conflict resolution

---

## 🔹 GitHub
> GitHub is a **cloud-based platform** that hosts Git repositories and provides collaboration tools for developers.  
It supports code sharing, version control, and team workflows through features like pull requests, issues, and GitHub Actions.

### 🔧 Key Services
- Remote repository hosting
- Pull requests and code reviews
- Issue tracking and project boards
- CI/CD with GitHub Actions

# 📁 Git Folder & File Utilities

- `git init` → Initializes Git in the current folder.
- `git add filename` → Stages a file for commit.
- `git add .` → Stages all files in the current directory.
- `git status` → Shows status of staged and unstaged files.
- `git rm --cached <file>` → Unstages a file (undo `git add`).
- `git commit -m "message"` → Commits staged changes with a message.
- `git log` → Shows full commit history.
- `git log --oneline` → Shows compact commit history.

---

## 🧾 Special Git Files

- `.gitignore` → Lists files/folders to exclude from tracking.
- `.gitkeep` → Placeholder file to push empty folders (must be inside the folder).

---

## 🖥️ Git Directory Navigation

- Use `cd D:\f1\f2` to navigate to your Git folder in terminal.
- Use **Git Graph extension** in VS Code to visualize commit history.

---

## 🎯 Interview Tips
- Git is the tool, GitHub is the platform.
- Git works offline; GitHub is online.
- Know the difference between `git pull` and `git fetch`.
- Understand staging vs committing vs pushing.
