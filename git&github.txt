# ✅ Git vs GitHub — Placement-Ready Definitions

## 🔹 Git
> Git is a **distributed version control system (VCS)** used to track changes in source code during development.  
It enables multiple developers to collaborate, manage versions, and maintain a history of code changes efficiently.

### 🔑 Key Features
- Local and remote repositories
- Branching and merging
- Commit history and rollback
- Conflict resolution

---

## 🔹 GitHub
> GitHub is a **cloud-based platform** that hosts Git repositories and provides collaboration tools for developers.  
It supports code sharing, version control, and team workflows through features like pull requests, issues, and GitHub Actions.

### 🔧 Key Services
- Remote repository hosting
- Pull requests and code reviews
- Issue tracking and project boards
- CI/CD with GitHub Actions

# 📁 Git Folder & File Utilities

## 🧠 Essential Git Commands Cheat Sheet

### 🔧 Initialization & Staging
- **`git init`** → Initializes a Git repository in the current folder.
- **`git add filename`** → Stages a specific file for commit.
- **`git add .`** → Stages all changes in the current directory.
- **`git status`** → Shows the status of staged and unstaged files.
- **`git rm --cached <file>`** → Unstages a file (undoes `git add`).

### 📦 Committing & History
- **`git commit -m "message"`** → Commits staged changes with a message.
- **`git log`** → Displays full commit history.
- **`git log --oneline`** → Shows a compact, one-line-per-commit history.

### 🌿 Branching
- **`git branch branchname`** → Creates a new branch.
- **`git switch branchname`** → Switches to the specified branch (modern syntax).
- **`git checkout branchname`** → Also switches branches (older syntax, still valid).

### 🧳 Stashing
- **`git stash`** → Temporarily saves changes not yet committed.
- **`git stash save "your message"`** → Saves stash with a custom message (legacy syntax).
- **`git stash list`** → Lists all stashed changes.
- **`git stash pop`** → Applies the most recent stash and removes it from the stash list.
- **`git stash drop`** → Deletes a stash entry.

### 🔀 Merging & Resetting
- **`git merge branchname`** → Merges the specified branch into the current branch.
- **`git reset --hard <commit-id>`** → Moves `HEAD` and resets the working directory to a specific commit (e.g., `e00cdc`).

---

## 🧾 Special Git Files

- `.gitignore` → Lists files/folders to exclude from tracking.
- `.gitkeep` → Placeholder file to push empty folders (must be inside the folder).

---

## 🖥️ Git Directory Navigation

- Use `cd D:\f1\f2` to navigate to your Git folder in terminal.
- Use **Git Graph extension** in VS Code to visualize commit history.

---

## 🎯 Interview Tips
- Git is the tool, GitHub is the platform.
- Git works offline; GitHub is online.
- Know the difference between `git pull` and `git fetch`.
- Understand staging vs committing vs pushing.
